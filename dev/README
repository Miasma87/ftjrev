Most of the fields are self-explanatory except the boundary scan cells.

Each cell is either a `bsc[N]' or `ext[N]'. `External' means that those
cells should not be set to drivers during operation, as they will drive
some logic that is not under JTAG control and which might be upset at
this (e.g. a PCI bus).

The format for this line is
{bsc|ext}[<index>] <name> <type>[<zval> <zindex>]

<name> is the name of the pin. <type> is I, O, Y or Z, where I is input,
O is output, Y is 3-state output and Z is bidirectional.

If a pin is Y or Z, it will have <zval> and <zindex>. <zindex> is the
index of a boundary scan cell that tristates this output cell, and <zval>
is the value that has to be written in there to tristate it.

Each file is named with the full 32-bit IDCODE field of its chip. The
tools will print this out, so don't worry about getting it right from
the specs/BSDLs.
